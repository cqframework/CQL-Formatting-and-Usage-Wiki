The Common CQL Assets for FHIR - US-Based specification is being balloted in the May 2025 Cycle:

* Ballot pool signup open now through April 3rd
* Voting open April 4th through May 4th

The implementation guide contains re-usable libraries of CQL for use with FHIR in the US-Realm:

* USCoreCommon: This library defines functions to expose extensions defined in USCore as fluent functions in CQL, as well as common terminology and functions used in writing CQL with FHIR and USCore profiles.
* USCoreElements: A library of expressions, functions, and terminology declarations for use with FHIR in the US Realm.
* CumulativeMedicationDuration: This library provides cumulative medication duration calculation logic for use with FHIR medication prescription, administration, and dispensing resources. The logic here follows the guidance provided as part of the 5.6 version of Quality Data Model.

These libraries are based on patterns and practices established in the measure development community, specifically the authoring patterns documented in this wiki:
