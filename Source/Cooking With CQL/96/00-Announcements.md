Ballot pool signup for the January 2026 cycle is currently open.

## FHIR R6 Normative Ballot

The FHIR specification will have a normative R6 ballot in the January 2026 cycle. All the content in the specification will be normative (it will _not_ be a mixed trial-use/normative publication like R4 was).

In particular this means:

1. Several of the resources that are still undergoing active development have moved out of the main specification and into _incubator_ IGs. The ballot introduction will have a listing of these, as well as pointers to where the resources moved.
2. Any ballot comments that result in substantive change to the specification will result in another ballot.
3. Only balloters that signed up for the first ballot (this ballot) will be able to participate in subsequent ballots.
4. Only material that was changed as a result of reconciliation in the first ballot will be subject to comment in subsequent ballots (unless otherwise allowed to be included by FMG approval)

## CDS Hooks Mixed Normative/Trial-Use Ballot

The CDS Hooks specification will have a mixed normative/trial-use ballot in the January 2026 cycle. The publication is currently under ballot readiness review by the CDS Work Group:
