## Parameters
```
parameter "Measurement Period" Interval<DateTime>
```

## Context
Within the Patient context, the results of any retrieve will always be scoped to a single patient, as determined by the environment. Patient-based or Encounter-based results will contain all data for a single patient within the Measurement Period as specified by the query constraints.
```
context Patient
```

## Expression `ED Encounter`
Returns encounters with codes from the "Emergency Department Visit" value set.

```
define "ED Encounter":
  ["Encounter, Performed": "Emergency Department Visit"]
```

## Expression `Inpatient Encounter`
Returns completed encounters with codes from the "Encounter Inpatient" value set when the inpatient  discharge date falls within the Measurement Period.

```
define "Inpatient Encounter":
  ["Encounter, Performed": "Encounter Inpatient"] EncounterInpatient
    where EncounterInpatient.relevantPeriod ends during day of "Measurement Period"
```

## Function `ToDateInterval(Interval<DateTime>) returns Interval<Date>`
Returns an interval of date values extracted from the input interval of date-time values.

This function returns an interval constructed using the `date from` extractor on the start and end values of the input date-time interval. Note that using a precision specifier, such as `day of`, as part of a timing phrase is preferred to communicate intent to perform day-level comparison, as well as for general readability. For example, Input Attribute 2022-02-01T00:00:00.000+00:00, Output Return 2022-02-01 (ISO-8601 format YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.msZ where Z is timezone offset -05:00 EST New York)

Unless otherwise specified, DateTime and Time comparisons (including interval operations on intervals of DateTime or Time) in CQL are performed to millisecond precision.  Be aware that datetime comparison involving different timezone offsets with a precision of less than 1 day granularity (e.g. hours) will normalize the timezone offset to that of the evaluation request timezone stamp. This may impact edge cases for boundaries such as Measurement Period, daylight savings transitions or across different time zone regions.

```
define function "ToDateInterval"(period Interval<DateTime>):
  Interval[date from start of period, date from end of period]
```

### Examples:
For example, the function could be used to get day-level comparison for an interval from a year before the start of the Measurement Period to the end of the Measurement Period as in the following. However, note that the function must still be used on both sides of the `during` operator.

```
define Example1:
  ["Physical Exam, Performed": "Observation Services"] RetinalExam
    where "ToDateInterval"("NormalizeInterval"(RetinalExam.relevantDatetime, RetinalExam.relevantPeriod))
      during "ToDateInterval"(Interval[start of "Measurement Period" - 1 year, end of "Measurement Period"])
```

## Function `LengthInDays(Interval<DateTime>) returns Integer`
Returns the number of days between the start and the end of a given interval. Calculates the difference in calendar days between the start and end of the given interval. Difference calculations are performed by truncating the datetime values at the next precision and then performing the corresponding duration calculation on the truncated values (midnights crossed). For example, [2022-02-01T23:00,2022-02-02T01:00] becomes [2022-02-01,2022-02-02] then returns 1 day.

```
define function "LengthInDays"(Value Interval<DateTime> ):
  difference in days between start of Value and end of Value
```

## Function `HospitalizationLocations("Encounter, Performed") returns List<Location>`
Returns a list of all facility locations within an encounter, including locations for an immediately prior Emergency Department visit, if any.

```
define function "HospitalizationLocations"(Encounter "Encounter, Performed" ):
  Encounter Visit
  	let EDVisit: Last(["Encounter, Performed": "Emergency Department Visit"] LastED
  			where LastED.relevantPeriod ends 1 hour or less on or before start of Visit.relevantPeriod
  			sort by 
  			end of relevantPeriod
  	)
  	return if EDVisit is null then Visit.facilityLocations 
  		else flatten { EDVisit.facilityLocations, Visit.facilityLocations }
```

        and HospitalLocation.locationPeriod during Encounter.relevantPeriod
      sort by start of locationPeriod
  )
```

## Function `NormalizeInterval(DateTime, Interval<DateTime>) returns Interval<DateTime>`
Given a datetime and a period, returns the period (if a period is provided) or the interval beginning and ending on the datetime (if a datetime is provided).  This allows evaluation of EHR data elements which might be stored as either DateTime or Period.

```
define function "NormalizeInterval"(pointInTime DateTime, period Interval<DateTime> ):
  if pointInTime is not null then Interval[pointInTime, pointInTime]
    else if period is not null then period 
    else null as Interval<DateTime>
```

## Function `HasStart(Interval<DateTime>) returns Boolean`
Given an interval, returns true if the interval has a starting boundary specified (i.e. the start of the interval is not null and not the minimum DateTime value). Function evaluates for an empty start of interval by checking for null, or for the presence of the lowest possible value. For inclusive (or closed) boundaries, indicated with square brackets, a null starting value means the interval starts at the minimum DateTime value. For exclusive (or open) boundaries, indicated with parentheses, a null starting value means the starting point of the interval is unknown, and comparisons against it will result in null.

```
define function "HasStart"(period Interval<DateTime> ):
  not ( start of period is null
      or start of period = minimum DateTime
  )
```

## Function `HasEnd(Interval<DateTime>) returns Boolean`
Given an interval, returns true if the interval has an ending boundary specified (i.e. the end of the interval is not null and not the maximum DateTime value). Function evaluates for an empty end of interval by checking for null, or for the presence of the highest possible value. For inclusive (or closed) boundaries, indicated with square brackets, a null ending value means the interval ends at the maximum DateTime value. For exclusive (or open) boundaries, indicated with parentheses, a null ending value means the ending point of the interval is unknown, and comparisons against it will result in null.

```
define function "HasEnd"(period Interval<DateTime> ):
  not ( 
    end of period is null
      or 
      end of period = maximum DateTime
  )
```

## Function `Latest(Interval<DateTime>) returns DateTime`
Returns the latest date and time from a given interval as the ending point if the interval has an ending boundary specified, otherwise returns the starting point.

```
define function "Latest"(period Interval<DateTime> ):
  if ( HasEnd(period)) then 
  end of period 
    else start of period
```

## Function `Earliest(Interval<DateTime>) returns DateTime`
Returns the earliest date and time from a given interval as the starting point if the interval has a starting boundary specified, otherwise returns the ending point.

```
define function "Earliest"(period Interval<DateTime> ):
  if ( HasStart(period)) then start of period 
    else 
  end of period
```

## Function `LatestOf(DateTime, Interval<DateTime>) returns DateTime`
Returns the last chronological date and time for a data element whether stored as a datetime or period. Depending upon the data available, priority is datetime, ending point of interval, then starting point of interval. 

```
define function "LatestOf"(pointInTime DateTime, period Interval<DateTime> ):
  Latest(NormalizeInterval(pointInTime, period))
```
## Function `EarliestOf(DateTime, Interval<DateTime>) returns DateTime`
Returns the first chronological date and time for a data element whether stored as a datetime or period. Depending upon the data available, priority is datetime, starting point of interval, then ending point of interval. 

```
define function "EarliestOf"(pointInTime DateTime, period Interval<DateTime> ):
  Earliest(NormalizeInterval(pointInTime, period))
```
