# CQL-Formatting-and-Usage-Wiki

Welcome to the CQL Formatting and Usage Wiki!

This wiki will serve as a collaborative workspace for the development of CQL formatting conventions and usage patterns for measure development.

The contents of this wiki are a work in progress and nothing contained here should be considered a final specification or recommendation for guidance. The content developed here will help guide and direct the process of finding conventions and usage patterns that meet the needs of the various stakeholders in the measure development community.

Please feel free to submit edits, comments, and concerns to this wiki, as well as examples of formatting and usage. We encourage active participation and look forward to your feedback!
